# 👋Hi I'm Ondřej,
**Senior Software Engineer | Open-Source Contributor | Tech Enthusiast**

🖥️ Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Ondřej, and I'm a software developer focused mainly on blockchains, web technologies, and automatization.
This is where I showcase my open-source work, though much of what I've created over the years is proprietary code for my clients.
